# Collabify

A tool that generates Spotify playlists based on real listening activity. With the option to invite friends and generate collaborative playlists together. An option to keep them automatically updated either `weekly` or `monthly`. And an option to add recommended music. The music is selected by ranking tracks based on reoccuring appearance and position through the `short-`, `medium-` and `long-term` time periods of each user. See it as a mix of Spotify's `On Repeat`, `Repeat Rewind` and `Discover Weekly` for multiple users.
