# Collabify

A tool that generates Spotify playlists based on real listening activity. With the option to invite friends and generate collaborative playlists together. An option to keep them automatically updated either `weekly` or `monthly`. And an option to add recommended music. The music is selected by ranking tracks based on reoccuring appearance and position through the `short-`, `medium-` and `long-term` time periods of each user. See it as a mix of Spotify's `On Repeat`, `Repeat Rewind` and `Discover Weekly` for multiple users.

I came up with the idea after making around 20 playlists for somebody that never really listened to any of them. I thought it would be cool to be able to just send somebody a link in the future so you directly have a mix of both of your favorite music.
